     * frame. The tradeoff for doing it this way is that new implemented effects only
     * need to override the given methods; once they do that, this function will
     * automatically connect the function to the given event, and we're good to go.
     *
     * Benchmark is ~1000 calls per second still runs at 60 FPS. This gets the greenlight.
